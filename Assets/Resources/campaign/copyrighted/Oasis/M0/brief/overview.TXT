MISSION OVERVIEW

LOCATION: Oasis Training Area A

You are one of the only survivors of the Mikhal's World Massacre. As one of the first veterans in a war against an unknown enemy, you have been chosen to participate in an elite training program. The Colonial Jump Forces, nicknamed the "Dreadnauts," use advanced, rocket-pack-assisted battle suits that turn a soldier into the equivalent of a flying tank. If you can complete your training, you will join their ranks. 

Your primary mission on Oasis is to achieve proficiency in the use of the new rocket-assisted combat suits.  Mastery of the rocket-packs only comes through experience.  Be aware that the rocket-pack converts fuel to ejected plasma slowly to gain thrust.  Due to the limited amount of plasma a rocket-pack can store, a jump-capable soldier can only sustain flight for a short period of time.  Long distances must be traversed in a series of short propulsions or "hops."
 
Jump to it.
